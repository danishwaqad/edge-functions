## Tutorial outline

Hello and welcome to the tutorial!

This tutorial will take you through using Edge Functions on Netlify to build the following URLs:

## 1. Hello, world

We'll write an Edge Function to serve the text `Hello, World from the edge!`

[/hello](https://getting-started-with-netlify-edge-functions.netlify.app/hello)

## 2. Serve an HTML template

We'll set up the project to serve static HTML template files from the /public directory.

[/hello-template](https://getting-started-with-netlify-edge-functions.netlify.app/hello-template)

## 3. Add location data to the HTML template

We'll write an Edge Function to intercept a static HTML template and update it using geolocation data at the edge.

[/hello-template?method=transform](https://getting-started-with-netlify-edge-functions.netlify.app/hello-template?method=transform)
